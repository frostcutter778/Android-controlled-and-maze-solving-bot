# Android-controlled-and-maze-solving-bot
Here, the code for the maze solving bot has been written alongside the code for establishing the connection among the bot and the mobile device via
the bluetooth module. Speed differences have been tuned, and the QTR sensor was calibrated to make it possible for the bot to follow the maze. 
In addition to this, the android application that was developed using the MIT App Inventor is being provided through which the bot 
can be controlled when the mode is switched to android. In the application there are five buttons, four for directing the bot and 1 button
for stopping the bot. A textbox is there within the app which displays the current action that the bot is undergoing. Each time any of the
buttons are being pressed, the commands are voiced out using text-to-speech which has been made possible using the MIT app inventor.
